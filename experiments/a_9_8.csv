First of all, this is not a sequel to the original ""The Sixth Sense"". This is one of those films that you just have to watch out loud to get the feel for what was going on in it. Secondly, the acting wasn't very good at all. The main character, played by John Leguizamo, seemed to be playing his usual role, and the supporting cast had no idea what he was talking about. Thirdly, some of my comments about the script weren't accurate.
