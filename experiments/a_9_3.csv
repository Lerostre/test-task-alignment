When I was a kid, I went to high school in New Jersey, and my father was the head football coach at that time. That's right, he was also the director of the football team. So, after highschool, we went into college, but by the time I got to senior year, they had lost their head coach. I didn't understand why it was that he couldn't get his head coaching job back. Well, one day, while I wasn't going to go to college anymore, my brother and I decided to take a trip down to the Bahamas to see what was going on.
