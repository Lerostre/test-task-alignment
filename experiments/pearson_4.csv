There are lots of reasons why you shouldn't watch this film. Firstly, the ending. If you don""t like the end of a movie, then you won't like this one.

The acting is atrocious, the story is contrived, and the cinematography is amateurish. Don't see it, because it's not worth renting. If you want to see something that isn't so good, go for it. There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this film. And if you are looking for a movie that makes you feel good about yourself, stay away from this one.

This movie doesn't even try to be funny, or scary, nor does it attempt to make fun of anything. In fact, most of it is not funny at all. I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this movie.

The film follows the same themes as the rest of the film, focusing on the relationship between the Mayor and his son, played by Michael Cimino. In this case, however, things don't go according to plan, as there is a major plot twist involving the assassination of two police officers, who are also involved in the case.",2.0037696,5.668781714968615

There are so many things that could have been done to make this movie work. For example, there is no doubt in my mind that the action scenes were better than the rest of the movie. They were more intense and made you feel like you were watching something real. In addition, some of these scenes really reminded me of ""Dracula"", which is one of my favorite movies of all time.

And if you don't believe me, I'll tell you why. First off, the writing is atrocious. The characters are so out of place that you've never seen them before. Most of them are in their early thirties or early fifties, with nothing more than a pair of glasses and a sweater on. Then there's one guy who looks like he was shot in high school, dressed in a tuxedo, wearing a white flannel shirt, looking like a boy from the '80s, staring at a picture of Santa Claus.
