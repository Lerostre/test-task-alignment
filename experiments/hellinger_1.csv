It's hard to believe that a movie based on a true story can be so bad. This movie has no redeeming qualities aside from the fact that it has absolutely no substance whatsoever. Even the music in the movie doesn't have anything to do with the story at all. In fact, it's just as bad as any other movie I have ever watched. I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes horror movies and/or comedy. If you're a fan of Stephen King or Robert Altman, then this could be a great movie for you.
