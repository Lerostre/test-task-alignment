The film starts out very well, but quickly gets bogged down in plot holes that make the whole thing look like an exercise in dumbed-down sci-fi. At one point, the main character (played by Kevin Spacey) is trying to save his daughter from her father, who's been attacked by a crazed killer. When he tries to help her, he ends up having a heart attack, which makes it seem like he's really trying hard to try and save her. All in all, this is a complete waste of your time.
