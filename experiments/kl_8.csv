It all comes to a head when the main character, played by Kevin Spacey, falls in love with a girl named Jennifer. The only thing that happens is that Jennifer ends up having an affair with Spaceys brother-in-law, who just happens to be the one who cheated on them. So, they go back to their dorm room to try and figure out what's going on. Unfortunately, things go wrong when Jennifer's boyfriend doesn't let them know about it until later in the film, when he finds out that Spaceies girlfriend is cheating on him and tries to blackmail him into having sex with her. Needless to say, this leads to Spaceie and Jennifer getting hit by cars and eventually falling in bed with each other.",-0.7235898,5.7709652960427515

There are a few plot holes along the way, such as the fact that the main character is an alcoholic who gets caught up in his wife's cheating on him. However, there is a lot of humor in this film. It's funny to see the love between a man and a woman, and even more funny when one of the women has cheated on her husband. Some of these moments are hilarious, some are sad, but overall, this movie is worth watching if you're a fan of bad movies.

However, he fails miserably and falls in love with a woman who appears to have a crush on him. She ends up cheating on her boyfriend, who happens to come from the same family as her, and they become romantically involved. Then there's the special effects, which are just awful. There's even a few scenes where you've never heard of them before. The story is very long, so if you don't know how to watch it, you won't be able to understand it all.
