For example, in the beginning, when the girls are trying to get back to their dorms, the main character is trying desperately to convince the girl to go home with him. But it turns out that he doesn't want her to stay with the man, so he tells her that she has to leave the house because he wants to have sex with her. It's a bit hard to tell if this is meant to be funny or not, since the scene where the two girls walk out of the building is kind of funny, except for the fact that the guy says ""I'm going to let you sleep with me"" and then they walk away. Overall, this movie is definitely one of my favorite movies of all-time. If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend it.",2.5900662,5.529845890965137

However, due to a severe illness, he's unable to go to school because of a mysterious disease that causes his brain to stop working. Soon, however, Yggrasill discovers that the disease is actually a deadly form of disease known as ""Toxoplasmosis.""
