hellinger_3,".... This movie is about a guy who is in love with his best friend and decides to get on with it. However, there are some problems with the movie. First of all, the plot is completely different from what you'd expect from this type of film. The main character is a porn star who has a crush on her ex boyfriend. She's been dating him for 5 years and he's not interested in her at all. It turns out that she's cheating on him by having sex with him. In the end, she ends up falling in bed with another guy and getting raped by him.<h/t: Hilarious!<p><b]The acting is top-notch.

hellinger_3,".... I have to admit, it wasn't very well done. The acting was poor, and most of the scenes were very contrived. For example, one scene in particular was filmed in a very small location. It was difficult to tell what was going on with the camera, because the locations were so small that we couldn't see much of them. There were a couple of scenes in which the main character was walking around the city at night, while the rest of his body was still asleep. Also, there was only one shot in the movie where the characters were sleeping. At one point, he was talking to a friend, who was sitting next to him in bed, when he started to wake up. Unfortunately, the scene where he woke up was one of several scenes that didn't make much sense.

I didn't know what to expect from this movie, and I don't want to bore you with too much of the plot, but suffice it to say that this isn't one of my favorite sci-fi/horror films of all time. It's just a shame that it wasn't released in theatres. This is a low-budget Sci-Fi/Horror film that doesn't really have much to offer in terms of acting, direction, or special effects. The script is pretty good, the cinematography is top-notch at best, there are some decent performances here and there, as well as a lot of action sequences.

There are many reasons for this film's existence. First and foremost, it is based on real events that took place in New York City at the beginning of World War II. Second, most of these events take place during the early years of WWII. Third, many of them take places during World Wars I and II as well. Fourth, some of those events actually take center stage during WW II.<ref name=""attachment_4"" align=""alignleft"" width=""100%"" height=""150"" />Of course, there are other factors that contribute to this movie's success.
