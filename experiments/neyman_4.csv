neyman_4,"..., but it has a lot more depth to it than you'd expect. I think it's a shame that there aren't more films like this made in the 80s and 90s. The acting is quite good and the cinematography is well done. As for the movie itself, it doesn't really have any redeeming qualities. There are some scenes that are not so well thought out that you can't help but laugh at them. For example, when one of the characters says that he wants to become a firefighter, he actually says something along the lines of: ""I want to be a fireman."" This is a very funny scene, even though it is not nearly as funny as it could have been. Overall, I give this film a 7 out of 10. If you're looking for a great comedy, this is definitely worth watching.",2.3340192,5.710619728199697

I'm not sure if it would have been a better movie if they didn't cut all the parts from the beginning to the end, because there are some scenes that are really bad, and I don't want to spoil it too much. The rest of the movie is just boring. There are a couple of things that make this movie great: 1) The music is good, but I can't really relate to it. 2) If you like action movies, you'll like this one.<3/10 from 5 votes out of 10.",-2.6067524,5.710619728199697
