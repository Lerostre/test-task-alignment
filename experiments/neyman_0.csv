Macy, and the second part is based on one of his best films, ""Night of the Living Dead"". It's nice to see Macy's work again with this film, especially since he starred in most of Macy-era comedies.

One thing that bothered me about this film is the fact that there were no female leads in it. Maybe because they didn't have the time or resources to make the films themselves. Well, maybe because there weren't any female lead characters at all. So, instead of having a female character, we had a male character who wasn't even supposed to be there at the end of each film. This made me think that maybe the writers didn´t actually want to do anything else with the characters. I can´nt believe how awful this whole thing was.
