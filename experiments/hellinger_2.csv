The movie starts out with a series of events that take place around the same time as the events in the previous movie. During this time, the characters begin to develop their personalities and relationships. Throughout the movie, each character is different from the one in previous films. For example, in ""The Sixth Sense"" the main character's relationship with his mom was very similar to the relationship between him and his sister. In ""Saving Private Ryan"", the two main characters are not as different as they once were. Instead, they are able to understand each other more than they did in earlier films such as ""A Wrinkle in Time"" and ""My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic"".<span class=""styles__noscript__2rw2y"" src=""http://dsx.weather.com//util/image/widescreen/bg300x150/normal.",1.1930007,5.671822226126195
