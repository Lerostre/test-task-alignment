The film has no explanation for why the killer is there, or why his victims are there at all.<p>The acting in this film is okay, but the production values aren't as good as they could have been. Some of the characters look like they're auditioning for roles in a movie, and some of them sound like actors trying to imitate real people. There are so many plot holes in the story that it's hard to tell which character is whom. A lot of problems with the script come from the fact that none of its characters seem to have any connection with each other. For example, one character seems to think he's going to be killed by the serial killers, while the other seems confused and confused when he comes across the body of someone he knows very little about.",-2.5337653,5.71129995571415
