a_7_3,"... the only good thing about this film is that it was shot on a very low budget. The acting was dreadful, the special effects were poor, and the story was contrived. Not to mention the cinematography was awful. It was like watching some kind of movie where you're supposed to be able to see something, but in reality, you don't even know what you are seeing. There was no sense of urgency in the plot or character development. I found myself trying not to care about any of the characters at all. They just seemed to go through the motions. In short, this is a waste of time and money. Don't waste your time or money on this movie. If you like sci-fi movies, then this one is for you.
