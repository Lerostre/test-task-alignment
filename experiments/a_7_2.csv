It's obvious that the actors don't really know what they're supposed to be doing, and it's hard to believe that they weren't given the ability to act at all. The movie also suffers from a few plot holes. For example, the ending isn't quite as good as it could have been. There are a number of inconsistencies in the story, such as the fact that one character is a drug addict, while another is an ex-con, who turns out to not be a heroin addict. However, these inconsistencies make up for the overall lack of interest in this film.
