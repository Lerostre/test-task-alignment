Plus, there are a number of other things that aren't as good, such as a bunch of alien abductions, a bit of nudity, lots of special effects, some nice sets, etc. All in all, this is a pretty good Sci-Fi movie, especially if you're looking for a low budget sci fi flick. 7 out of 10.",1.5860234,5.64158112937412
