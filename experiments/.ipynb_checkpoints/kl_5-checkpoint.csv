kl_5,"... I don't think I've seen a movie like that before, and I'm not exactly sure what to make of it. The acting isn't all that good, the writing isn`t as good as it should have been, etc., etc. There is a lot of nudity in the movie, but it`s just plain annoying. It`d be fun to watch, especially if you`re a fan of teen flicks like this one. If you like teen comedies, you will love this movie. However, if your looking for a low-budget, low budget horror movie with plenty of laughs, then you might want to avoid this film at all costs. 7 out of 10. 8/10.",-1.8685212,5.479251417984567

kl_5,"... and I can't think of a better way to describe this movie than ""The Godfather III.""< br />< br >This movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. In fact, the only redeemable thing about this film is that it is so over-the-top, ridiculous, and cheesy that you don't care at all what happens next. The script is horrible and the acting is atrocious. All in all, this is one of the worst movies ever made. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see a bad movie with good acting, good cinematography, some good music, great story lines, lots of gore, tons of sex, nudity, violence, profanity, etc. Don't waste your time or money on this garbage.
