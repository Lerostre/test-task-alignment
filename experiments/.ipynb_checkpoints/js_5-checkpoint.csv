js_5,"... to be honest, I didn't expect much from this movie. The acting was decent, the writing was good, and the special effects were very good. However, there were a few problems with the movie: 1) There wasn't enough action in the film; 2) The music was terrible; 3) Some of the scenes were really long; 4) A number of scenes looked like they were shot on video instead of a CD; and 5) Most of all, it seemed like there was too much action. This is one of those movies that you won't want to miss. If you're looking for something a little different, this is a must-see. 8 out of 10.",-1.0091648,5.557999634595943
