a_1_3,"... The movie is pretty good, and the acting is very good. This is one of my all-time favorite movies. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys sci-fi, fantasy, horror, comedy, or any other genre. If you don't like Sci-Fi/Fantasy, then this may be for you. It has a lot going for it, but it's definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of sci fi/fantasy. You won't be disappointed. 8 out of 10.",2.7653787,5.249465358706173
a_1_3,"... a little bit too much of a melodrama. It's about a guy who has an affair with a beautiful girl, but ends up cheating on her, so she doesn't get involved with him. This isn't very good, and there are a few parts that don't make any sense at all. The acting is terrible, the writing is poor, some of the scenes are really annoying, especially the ending. Overall, I give this a 4/10. 7 out of 10. 8 out 100. 9 out 200. 10 out 5 stars. All in all, if you like melodsrama, this is for you. If you're a fan of Melodramas, check it out. You'll love it. Don't miss this one.",-2.2924309,5.249465358706173
