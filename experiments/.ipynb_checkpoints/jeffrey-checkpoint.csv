jeffrey,... the acting was so bad I couldn't sit through it. The plot was awful and the story wasn't interesting enough to be worth watching. It seemed like a waste of time and money. <3 out of 10.,-3.1306028,4.698587442564424
jeffrey,"... the film is about a group of friends trying to get together and try to figure out what happens when they decide to commit suicide. The film starts with the idea that we're all going to have to go back to school, but then it turns into something totally different. We're supposed to be able to relate to our friends and find out who we really are, which is why we end up in the same situation.<citation needed)<spoiler]There's also a lot of heart-wrenching stuff happening in this film, and there's a scene where one of the members of a sorority tries to convince me that she's going through some sort of mental breakdown, so I guess I'm not sure what was going on. But overall, this is one hell of an interesting film. So if you're looking for a good horror film with lots of suspense and a great cast, check this one out. It's certainly worth a look. 7 out of 10.",2.501062,4.698587442564424
