pearson,"... the acting was so bad I had to watch it again and again. All in all, this film is not a great horror film at all. The acting is good, but if you like scary movies with bad acting, don't bother watching this one. If you are looking for a good horror movie with good acting and lots of scares, stay away from this crap. You won't be disappointed. Don't waste your time or money on this.",-2.711067,4.686221400201812
