This film seems to have been made for the big screen and I'm glad I watched it. Unfortunately, the production values of this film are very poor. For example, in one scene, there's a group of girls having sex on the floor of a building. In another scene they're having oral sex in the middle of the night. There's absolutely no plot at all in this movie. It's hard to tell what's going on with the characters throughout the entire movie.",-2.9004364,5.422394918162762
