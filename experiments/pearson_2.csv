It starts off very well, and ends very slowly, which is great for people who like to spend more time with their kids. Also, the acting is quite good, as are the special effects.

I have to say that when I first saw this film, I thought it was going to be one hell of a movie. The cinematography was great and the acting was top notch. However, after seeing the trailer, in my opinion, it's hard not to like this movie as well. As for the plot, well, there are many twists and turns that go along with it. There are only so many ways you can go about finding out what happened to the two young girls, who ended up in the hospital, and why they end up together.
