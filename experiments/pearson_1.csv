The acting isn't as good as it needs to be, and some of what you see in this movie doesn't quite match up with what I've seen so far. There are some scenes where the actors seem to have a lot of fun (the scene where one of them gets shot in the face with a gun is particularly funny) and there's a couple moments when the actor seems to lose control of his voice. Also, there are a few sequences where we get the impression that the main character is being played by a different actor than he actually is.
