The only good things about this movie are the scenes where the characters interact with each other and the action scenes in which they fight against each others. This would have made a good movie if there were any plot at all. Instead, it just ends up as a bunch of angry teenagers fighting over who gets kicked in the face for being gay. Overall, I give this a 2 out of 10.<p><span style=""font-weight:bold"" align=""center"" class=""western""><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_rights_of_the_same_sex_people"" target=""_blank"" title=""Gay Rights of the Same Sex People"" /><img src="" http://i.imgur.",-2.6434495,5.825884389382092

Another scene is at the end when they meet up with the boyfriend of their friend who is cheating on them. I think this is the best part of this movie.
