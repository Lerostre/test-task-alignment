cnp_3,".... This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I can't believe it was made in such a short period of time. The acting is horrible, the cinematography is terrible, and the script is just plain awful. It's like watching a bad remake of ""The Blair Witch Project"" with all the new material thrown in. Not only that, but there are so many scenes in this movie that have no character development at all. Even if you don't want to see it, you will still find something to love in it. You'll be laughing out loud throughout the entire movie. If you haven't seen it yet, give it a shot. <3 out of 10.",-2.963788,5.352211199691254

One of my favorite parts of this film was when the two main characters come face to face with each other and the emotions that they go through. The scene where the girl comes home from work is one of pure magic. I love every moment of it. It's such a touching and touching movie. This is definitely one to watch over and over again.

cnp_3,"... I'm not sure if it's because of the fact that there isn't a lot of screen time, or if the film is shot on location, but it seems to be shot in a way that doesn't make any sense at all. The camera angles are pretty poor at best, and the effects aren't very good either. Overall, this is one of my favorite Sci-Fi movies out there.

cnp_3,"... in my opinion, it is the worst movie I've ever seen.<BR /><B />The acting is atrocious, the direction is horrible, and the special effects are terrible. The only redeeming quality of the film is that it does not have the same level of originality as many of its predecessors. Also, there is no sense of humor to be found throughout the movie. It's hard to believe that so many people out there are even willing to watch this trashy, over-the-top piece of crap. I don't give a damn how bad it was, or how good it got at the box office, but for some reason, I just couldn't get enough of it. If you haven't seen it yet, you'll LOVE it!
