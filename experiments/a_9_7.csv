At times, I found myself asking myself, ""How did this happen?"" or ""Who cares? What happened?"" In any case, you know what I'm talking about. There is not a lot of depth in this movie at all, but it does have some good moments, such as when one of them tries to tell the whole story, and then ends up telling the entire thing in one fell swoop.
